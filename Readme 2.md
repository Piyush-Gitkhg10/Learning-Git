# Summarising Observations

1. Using visual studio code is best
2. Makrdown files on the local machine are automatically designed to open in Visual studio code
3. Always use commit with some message attached to it otherwise it will cause problem.
    3.1 Using GitHub and Git will make me habitual to it.
4. Adding this line to use "diff" "--staged" and "checkout" commands.
 4.1 Used "diff" its flag "--staged" and "checkout" command, one after another.
    4.2 Wasn't able to get it done in the first try.
    4.3 But succeded eventually with the help of the tutorial video.
    4.4 Knew one more command i.e., "reset" command, that will be necessary in this whole process.
5. The "reset" command is necessary to drop the files once they have been staged. Meaning files were added using "add" command.
6. And the checkout command is used to revert all the changes to the last commit. 
    6.1 Even if the files are commited.
7. Preview of the readme.md files do not Preview in the same manner as it is written here (In the code editor).
    7.1 So to fix this used pre tag. 
        7.1.1 It was a dirty fix, so it needs to be fixed.
